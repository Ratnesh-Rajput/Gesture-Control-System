# Gesture controller:

This project uses the Python OpenCV module to detect hand gestures. By using computer vision techniques, the program captures the movements of the user's hand (& ***proposed:*** translates them into corresponding actions in the game), after that it translates those actions to direction keys(***WASD***). 



## Installation

Run the following command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If a error involving mediapipes pops, solve it via running this command:
```
py -m pip install mediapipe
```

## Usage

#### Using PC camera:
- Run `python main-pc-cam.py`


And put your hand in front of the Camera to provide directions (previewed in the console), which when integrated can be used to control motion virtually! ðŸš—
