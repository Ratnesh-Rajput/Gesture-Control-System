# Hand controller: control cars ðŸš— using hands, in Games

This project uses the Python OpenCV module to detect hand gestures and control a car in GTA 5. By using computer vision techniques, the program captures the movements of the user's hand and translates them into corresponding actions in the game. This allows the user to drive the car, change directions, and perform other actions simply by moving their hand in front of the camera.
